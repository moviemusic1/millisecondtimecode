# millitime

This project lets you copy the unix timestamp of the current moment,
you can use this e.g. to still know later, when you were done with a project.

Currently, there is a [version right in/for your browser](https://lymnyx.github.io/millisecondtimecode/) (written in JavaScript) and one for your terminal (written in Python).
